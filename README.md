# Regulatory Change Impact — starter

Build a reusable Skill that connects regulatory changes to company impacts and draft compliance actions.

## Start

1. Read the [formal assignment](https://private-pecorino-70e.notion.site/Project-B-Regulatory-Change-Impact-Compliance-Actions-Learner-assignment-3da0b700541e8152b6d1c638fd1c34fa?source=copy_link) for the work and acceptance requirements.
2. Create your own repository from [this starter](https://github.com/GitRollTraining/regulatory-compliance) using **Fork**, then clone your copy and work there.

## Supplied files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Starting instructions and links. |
| `snapshot.schema.json` | Public snapshot contract; keep it unchanged. |

Create the Skill, implementation and outputs described in the formal assignment. This starter supplies no business workflow implementation.

## Before you work

**Interview rule.** You conduct the stakeholder interview yourself, and the questions are yours. Do not connect a coding agent or any other AI to the interview to run, script, or automate it. The interview transcript is assessed together with the code; a project whose interview was run by an agent is not scored.

- Export your interview as the original Work Sim Markdown, save one final complete file per session under `interviews/`, and commit and push it with your code. Do not rewrite the export. If the export is unavailable, contact the facilitator.

- Use an Agent Skills-capable coding environment. Choose and document your implementation runtime and dependencies; no runtime or install command is supplied here.
- Follow the [shared course guide for session capture](https://classroom.google.com/c/ODcyMjA4NTkwNDk2/m/ODc0NzI2NzQzMzQ2/details) and verify capture is active before implementation. Keep credentials out of the repository.
- Meet the [stakeholder](https://work-sim.catalyte.ai/s/project-b-regulatory-compliance) to understand the work and relevant business sources. Read those online sources through their intended access route; an unavailable source is not permission to substitute repository data.

## Implemented workflow

The seven-stage draft workflow is in `regulatory-change-impact-brief/`. Start with
[the operating guide](docs/operating-guide.md) for pinned setup, Codex/source access,
authorized scope, authenticated feedback, output statuses and fresh recovery.

```sh
python3 regulatory-change-impact-brief/scripts/run.py --config config/review.json
```

Every production invocation performs fresh source attempts. The generated register,
brief and tentative calendar are drafts for human review. Verification fixtures
are explicitly synthetic. [Canonical evaluations](docs/evaluations.md) explain
how to reproduce implementation checks; U20 remains an independent final audit.
